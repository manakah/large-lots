Dear {{ app.first_name }},

Over the past few months we have been reviewing the 4,500 requests for property we received from the 2,800 Large Lot applications.

At this time, the Department of Planning and Development will not be proceeding with the sale of the lot listed below:

{{ lot.address }}
{{ lot.pin | make_display_pin }}
            
This summer, the Department of Planning and Development will be launching a new housing program in this area.  More information on the program will be available at www.cityofchicago.org/dpd.

Thank you for your application and we look forward to working with you in the future.
        
Sincerely,

Jeanne Chandler

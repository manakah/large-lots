Dear {{ app.first_name}},

Congratulations! The City is moving forward with your Large Lot application. The next step in the process is to collect an <strong>Economic Disclosure Statement (EDS)</strong> and <strong>Principal Profile Form (PPF)</strong> from each applicant. The EDS helps us to identify you, and the PPF provides us with the information necessary to make sure you do not owe money to the City.

For organizations and corporations, you must use <a href="https://webapps1.cityofchicago.org/EDSWeb/appmanager/OnlineEDS/desktop?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=OnlineEDS_portal_page_26" target="_blank">the standard EDS form</a>. 

For individuals, please use <a href="https://eds.datamade.us/?app_id={{app.id}}">the following link to complete the EDS</a>

For all applicants, please complete <a href="">the PPF</a>, and email back to me at Jeanne.Chandler@Cityofchicago.org.

If you need assistance completing the EDS or PPF please reach out to the Large Lot Staff. <strong>Failure to complete these two documents by August 9 will result in your removal from the Large Lot Program.</strong>
        
Sincerely,

Jeanne Chandler

Dear {{ app.first_name}},

Your Large Lot Application is being denied because you did not provide EDS and PPF information within the required time frame.

The City will not be moving forward with the sale of the following lots to you:

{% for lot in lots %}
    {{ lot.address }}
    {{ lot.pin | make_display_pin }}
{% endfor %}

You may be able to apply again in future rounds of the Large Lot Program. Check our website, www.largelots.org, periodically for information on our next application round.

We look forward to working with you in the future.

Best,

Jeanne Chandler

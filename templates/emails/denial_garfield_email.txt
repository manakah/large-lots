Dear {{ app.first_name }},

Over the past few months we have been reviewing the 4,500 requests for property we received from the 2,800 Large Lot applications.

At this time, the Department of Planning and Development will not be proceeding with the sale of the lot listed below:

{{ lot.address }}
{{ lot.pin | make_display_pin }}
            
This summer, the Department of Planning and Development will begin a community planning process in your area. Information will be posted at www.cityofchicago.org/DPD shortly. Your participation is encouraged.

Thank you for your application.
        
Sincerely,

The Large Lots Team

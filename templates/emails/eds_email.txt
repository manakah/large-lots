Dear {{ app.first_name}},

Congratulations! The City is moving forward with your Large Lot application. The next step in the process is to collect an <strong>Economic Disclosure Statement (EDS)</strong> and <strong>Principal Profile Form (PPF)</strong> from each applicant. The EDS helps us to identify you, and the PPF provides us with the information necessary to make sure you do not owe money to the City.

For individuals, please use <a href="https://eds.largelots.org/?tracking_id={{app.tracking_id}}">the following link to complete the EDS</a>.

For all applicants, please use <a href="https://www.largelots.org/principal-profile-form/?tracking_id={{app.tracking_id}}">the following link to complete the PPF</a>.

<strong>Please note: both of these documents must be submitted on {{date}} by {{time}} or you will not be eligible to purchase property through the Large Lot Program.</strong> If you need assistance completing the EDS or PPF, please contact The Large Lots Team or Kim Harrison at 312-744-0605 or <a href="mailto:kim.harrison@cityofchicago.org">kim.harrison@cityofchicago.org</a>. 

For organizations and corporations, you must use <a href="https://webapps1.cityofchicago.org/EDSWeb/appmanager/OnlineEDS/desktop?_nfpb=true&_pageLabel=OnlineEDS_portal_page_26" target="_blank">the standard EDS form</a>. 
        
Sincerely,

The Large Lots Team

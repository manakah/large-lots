# Large Lots

The City of Chicago is selling vacant lots for $1. Here's how you get one.

## Configuring and running locally

We recommend using [virtualenv](http://virtualenv.readthedocs.org/en/latest/virtualenv.html) and [virtualenvwrapper](http://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html) for working in a virtualized development environment. [Read how to set up virtualenv](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/).

Once you have virtualenvwrapper set up, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
mkvirtualenv largelots -p /path/to/your/python3
git clone git@github.com:datamade/large-lots.git
cd large-lots
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Set the environmental variables in [local_settings.py.example](https://github.com/datamade/large-lots/blob/master/lots/local_settings.py.example) (then drop the .example suffix):

  * ``SECRET_KEY`` - Djangoâ€™s [Secret Key](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/ref/settings/#secret-key) used by the project. Can be any relatively hard to guess string.

  * ``AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME`` - the name of the AWS bucket where deed uploads (PDFs, images) reside; for local development you can use: largelots-test-uploads

  * ``AWS_ACCESS_KEY`` - AWS key used by the file storage mechanism to store files in S3.

  * ``AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`` - The secret that goes with the key above.

  * ``EMAIL_HOST, EMAIL_PORT, EMAIL_USE_TLS, EMAIL_HOST_USER, EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD`` - These are used to configure the email settings for Django. See [Django docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.6/topics/email/) for more info.

  * ``SENTRY_DSN`` - This is a connection string for [Sentry](http://getsentry.com).

Run the app:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Navigate to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/).

## Sending emails

We have a management command that facilitates sending emails in bulk. It takes several arguments, including an option to send emails to applicants needing to complete the Economic Disclosure Statement:

```bash
python manage.py send_emails --eds_email=87
```

The arguments after `--eds_email` refer to the number of applications who should receive emails.

## Testing

Export your settings:

```bash
export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=lots_admin.tests.test_config
```

Run the tests:
```bash
pytest lots_admin/tests
```

## Data

Our map was built using open data from Chicago and Cook County:

* [Chicago - City Owned Land Inventory](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Community-Economic-Development/City-Owned-Land-Inventory/aksk-kvfp)

* [Cook County - 2012 Parcels](https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/GIS-Maps/ccgisdata-Parcel-2012/e62c-6rz8)

## Dependencies
